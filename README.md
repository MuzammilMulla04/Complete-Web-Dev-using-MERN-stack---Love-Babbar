# Complete Web Development using MERN Stack – Love Babbar

This repository contains my personal notes, code, and progress while learning Full Stack Web Development using the MERN Stack from **Love Babbar’s Complete Web Dev Series**.

---

## 📌 Overview

The MERN stack is a collection of technologies used to build full-stack web applications:

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for flexible data storage.
- **Express.js** – Backend web application framework.
- **React.js** – Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Track my day-wise learning progress.
- Maintain well-structured notes and code.
- Build mini-projects as practical implementations.
- Serve as a reference for revision and future development.
